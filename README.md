## Description

<p align="center">This applications foundation was built completely from scratch (i.e., each package was manually installed) for a truly customized product.</p>

<p align="center">Notable technologies used:</p>
<p align="center">React</p>
<p align="center">React Router</p>
<p align="center">Node</p>
<p align="center">TypeScript</p>
<p align="center">Redux</p>
<p align="center">SASS/SCSS</p>
<p align="center">Axios</p>
<p align="center">Webpack</p>
<p align="center">Materialize</p>
<p align="center">ESLint</p>
<p align="center">Prettier</p>
<p align="center">Husky</p>

<p align="center"> This application began with the intent to create a search engine utilizing Google's search API in a custom search engine.  During development, many of the ideas to be implemented were modeled after the Google search engine itself (e.g., keywords, mobile views, conditional rendering), ultimately leading development to essentially re-create much of Google's front-end.</p>

## Download and Installation

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/droman892/typed-searcher.git` 
## Usage

After the project files are downloaded, in the terminal, in the root folder, run `npm run build` to install the dependencies and update the `build` folder within the `client` directory.  Then, run `npm run dev` to start the application (refer to `localhost:3000` when editing the front-end, and `localhost:5000` when editing the back-end).

## Roadmap

This application is an on-going project, open to contributions and critique.  Functionality that would appropriately flesh out the application include the following:
1) incorporate automated testing
2) fetch and display data from the Google Trends API
3) add functionality to display multiple pages of data
