<p align="center"> This is a Google look-alike application featuring both of Google's own keywords and search API. </p>  

<p align="center"> :iphone: :mag: :computer: </p>

## Description

<p align="center">This application's foundation was built completely from scratch (i.e., each package was manually installed) for a truly customized product.</p>

<p align="center">Notable technologies used:</p>
<p align="center">React</p>
<p align="center">React Router</p>
<p align="center">Node</p>
<p align="center">TypeScript</p>
<p align="center">Redux</p>
<p align="center">SASS/SCSS</p>
<p align="center">Axios</p>
<p align="center">Webpack</p>
<p align="center">Materialize</p>
<p align="center">ESLint</p>
<p align="center">Prettier</p>
<p align="center">Husky</p>

<p align="center"> This application began with the intent to create a search engine utilizing Google's search API in a custom search engine.  During development, many of the ideas to be implemented were modeled after the Google search engine itself (e.g., keywords, mobile views, conditional rendering), ultimately leading development to essentially re-create much of Google's front-end.</p>
